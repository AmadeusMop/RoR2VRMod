## This mod is a fix for the VR mod which is NOT INCLUDED
Your character will now always shoot where you're looking (so, it basically follows the crosshair as it should).
Also works well with the [first person mod](https://thunderstore.io/package/mistername/FirstPersonView/).

The VR mod can be found [here](http://bit.ly/ror2VR).

This mod will include the VR mod in the future. UI fixes are also on the way.
